 * The Todo run ledger's wire shapes (ICI-728) — one row per work ATTEMPT.
 *
 * Kept apart from the rest of the client because a run carries a pairing rule
 * none of the other work-item shapes do: an attempt is OPEN (no end, no
 * outcome) or SETTLED (both), never half of each. A reader that forgets the
 * pair invents an outcome for work still in flight. `api.ts` re-exports all of
 * it, so no caller had to move with it — and nothing here imports a VALUE back
 * from `api.ts`, which is what keeps the re-export from reading a function
 * before it exists.
