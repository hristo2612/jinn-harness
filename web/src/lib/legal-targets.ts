// Todos v2 slice 6 — the ONE client-side legality map (design-doc §5, §7.3).
// Mirrors packages/jinn/src/work-items/transitions.ts for a MANUAL move made on
// the operator (human) surface: board drag, the status pickers, and keyboard
// moves all consume this module — never their own edge lists. The data lives in
// transition-edges.json; the gateway parity test
// (packages/jinn/src/work-items/__tests__/board-legality-parity.test.ts) probes
// the real transition() against that file, so drift fails a build, not a user.
//
// The UI pre-checks; the server stays the authority. A runtime refusal (version
// conflict, a child created mid-drag) still snaps back with the gateway's words.
