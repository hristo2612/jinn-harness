/**
 * The app's icon set, keyed by name.
 *
 * Name-keyed rather than a component a caller imports, because the caller we
 * added this for is a plugin: the runtime loader's allowlist is the SDK, React
 * and the JSX runtime, so a plugin cannot import an icon library at all. A
 * curated map costs the loader nothing, and it keeps a lucide version out of a
 * public contract that a plugin author has no way to install against.
 *
 * Names are the contract — a plugin writes them as strings — so a rename here
 * is a breaking change and an addition is not.
