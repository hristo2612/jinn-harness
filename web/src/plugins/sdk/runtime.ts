/**
 * The runtime half of the two delivery modes in `.plans/plugins.md` §4.
 *
 * A bundled plugin resolves `@jinn/plugin-sdk` through the Vite alias. A disk
 * `client.js` writes the same specifier and has to land on the same object, so
 * the loader installs the live namespaces on globals and rewrites the specifier
 * to a shim module that reads them back off `globalThis`. React is the
 * mechanism rather than a convenience: a plugin that resolved a second React
 * would get a second dispatcher and every hook it called would throw.
 *
 * Export names are derived from the namespace instead of listed here, so adding
 * an export to the SDK barrel cannot leave the shim behind.
