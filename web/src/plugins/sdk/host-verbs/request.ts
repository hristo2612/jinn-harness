/**
 * The one way a browser verb reaches the gateway.
 *
 * Every verb is one request to an endpoint the dashboard already calls, over the
 * app's own `authFetch` — so a plugin inherits the operator's session and the
 * gateway's own authorization, and no route exists that serves plugins alone.
 * Each verb passes the permission gate first; that call is the seam, and a verb
 * that skipped it would be a verb no policy could ever refuse.
