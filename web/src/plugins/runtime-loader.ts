/**
 * The no-build ESM door (`.plans/plugins.md` §4). One `client.js` takes this
 * pipeline:
 *
 *   source -> reject unsupported bare specifiers -> rewrite the mapped ones to
 *   live shim blobs -> blob `import()` -> validate the default export ->
 *   `register(ctx)`
 *
 * Registration is unconditional: the gateway only serves the client half of a
 * plugin the operator enabled in `config.yaml`, so being handed a source here
 * IS the decision. The dashboard keeps no enablement state of its own.
 *
 * Loading an id that is already live disposes the previous incarnation first,
 * so a saved edit is a clean reload rather than a second registration beside
 * the first.
 *
 * SECURITY, and §9 is blunt about it: this is error isolation, not a capability
 * boundary. A loaded plugin is evaluated as ESM in the dashboard's own realm
 * with the app's full authority. It cannot crash the app; it can do anything the
 * app can. That is acceptable for a local directory the operator controls, and
 * it is exactly why a remote source may not reuse this pipeline as it stands.
